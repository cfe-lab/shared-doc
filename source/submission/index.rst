You can send data to the SHARED database for integration using the
`SHARED data submission page`_. You'll be sent a **secure, unique
link** which you can use to submit a **.ZIP file** containing your
data. This mechanism ensures that the data transfer is confidential,
secure, and protected against interference from malicious third
parties.

.. warning:: Don't send data to SHARED via email; we can't guarantee
             the confidentiality of data submitted by email.

Data should be formatted according to one of the **data submission
schemes** documented in this section. It specifies how clinical,
demographic, and viral sequence data should be formatted so that the
SHARED project can merge data **efficiently and consistently**. For
cases where each study participant only has a single record, the
:ref:`flat_scheme` is the simpler way to format your data. For more
detailed studies (e.g. where particpants have multiple follow up
results), or if your data is already in a database system, the
:ref:`multi_table_scheme` may be more appropriate.

As always, if you have questions about the data schemes or need help
formatting your data, contact the SHARED project.

The whole data submission process is:

1. Format your data using either the :ref:`flat_scheme` or the
   :ref:`multi_table_scheme`.
2. Create a .ZIP file with your tables and sequence data.
3. Get a unique data submission link.
4. Follow your link to the secure data submission page and use it to
   submit your data.
