Flat Submission Data Scheme
---------------------------

This scheme can be used if each participant has only a single
clinical, behavior, and treatment record. The submission will be a
single CSV or Excel file with columns as described below. Required
fields are marked with a bullet (â€¢). We don't expect everyone to have
data for each field; fields that don't apply to your study should be
omitted.
